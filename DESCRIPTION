Description: Calculates differential coexpression of multiple feature pairs between two  or more subgroups of samples, using an ANOVA test for multiple correlations versus a global correlation.  This test is based on the Chow statistic, which uses the sum of squared residuals between correlation submodels and a global model of correlation between each feature pair. Useful for determining which genes and gene pairs have been perturbed in gene expression experiments across clinically or biologically relevant subgroups in a  large population of samples, such as subtypes of health and disease. Also useful for determining differences  between a global gene coexpression network edges and subgroup-specific gene coexpression networks. Can rapidly  scale to >billions of feature pairs using both a multicore and multinode parallelization scheme, enabling  multi-omic feature pair comparisons for millions of input features.
